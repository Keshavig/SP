# Sarchi

![Sarchi Image](./img/img.png?raw=true "Sarchi Image")

<br>
A simple neofetch-like program.
Only Works in linux.
I use arch so it works in arch but should work in all linux distros

# Configuration
- Configure the program and components being loaded by changing sarchi.hpp
- Change the logo being loaded by making your own ascii logo in logos/ and include that in sarchi.hpp
- Always build the program after changing any of the source or header files

# Build
In sarchi directory, run following command
```bash
make clean all install clean
```
